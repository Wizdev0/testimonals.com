            <h4 class="note1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined . I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h4>

            <p class="sub1">*I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking  to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course  and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software enginner at a VR startup.*</p>

                Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
            </h4>

            <p class="sub3">*Before joining the bbotcamp , I've never written a line of code . I needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step . I was encouraged to enroll by a formal student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were hands on and I never had to wait long for for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommended!*</p>

            <p class="sub5">*The staff seem genuiuely concerned about my progress which I find refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out to the world and present myself as a capable junior developer . The standard is above the rest . You will get the personal anttention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.* </p>
